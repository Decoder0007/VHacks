# Cappuccino Example
This is an example Geometry Dash modding project using Cappuccino and MinHook. It adds a button to the main scene which brings you to a custom scene, and that scene itself has it's own custom behavior. Compile in x86.

If you have any questions, the people in the [Geometry Dash Programming Discord](https://discord.gg/sxkQAz9aQD), myself included, would be happy to assist you!
